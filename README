To build the compiler, run `make` in the toplevel project directory. Note that
the `make` process will attempt to `git clone` a secondary repository (the
parser generator project at https://github.com/CollinReeser/ParserGenerator),
which is necessary to build the compiler.

`./compiler --help` will provide a summary of options.
